<h3 id="task-4-barycentric-coordinates">Task 4: Barycentric Coordinates</h3>
<p>Barycentric coordinates can be seen as a way to figure out the distance from the three vertices of a triangle, providing a coordinate system that is relative to the triangle. They allow us to smoothly blend attributes at the vertices of a triangle. The attribute of interest for us is color in this part, but it can also be used to help translate between image and texture coordinates by blending the texture coordinates at each of the vertices.</p>
<p>This is some tex that I would like to see rendered: <eq env="displaymath">\sqrt{3}</eq>. This is some other text. Please tell me thereâ€™s no stupid extra square root somewhere here.</p>
