Hi there! I'm Paul. Iâ€™m a physics major turned programmer. Ever since
I first learned how to program while taking a scientific computing for
physics course, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a
career. Check out [my personal website](https://www.lenpaul.com/) for
more information on my other projects (including more Jekyll themes!),
as well as some of my writing.

Now I am going to see what it's like to use some $\LaTeX$. Let's see
if we can tell that $\sqrt{9} = 3$ and $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Please
tell me that these look good.

```cpp
class Yeet {
private:
  int deez_nuts;
public:
  void yeet() {
    deez_nuts++;
  }
}
```
