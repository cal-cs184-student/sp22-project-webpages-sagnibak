## Overview 

The first half of this project was getting comfortable with implementing the iterative De Casteljau algorithm, starting from the 2D curve and using that as a building block to implement the 3D Bezier surfaces. 

The second half of this project was focused on familiarizing ourselves with the halfedge datastructure with the ultimate goal of upsampling. 

## Task 1: BÃ©zier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision

De Casteljau's algorithm iteratively evaluates Bezier curves and is parameterized
by a list of control points and a parameter t that ranges from 0 to 1. To evaluate
the BezierCurve, we implemented the `evaluateStep` function which takes $n$ control
points and returns the next level of $n-1$ control points.
