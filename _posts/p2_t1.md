## Task 1: Bézier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision

De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive algorithm used to evaluate
polynomials written as a linear combination of Bernstein basis
polynomials. This algorithm is used to evaluate Bézier curves. In
order to evaluate a cubic Bézier curve, we need to do a tree of lerps,
involving six lerps in total. In order to evaluate a Bézier curve with
