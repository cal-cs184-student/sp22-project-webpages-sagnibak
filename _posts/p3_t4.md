## Indirect Lighting 

To implement indirect lighting, we used the Russian Roulette estimation method to construct a unbiased estimate of the lighting. 

The estimator we use is $\frac{\text{bsdf sample}\cdot \text{at least one bounce radiance} \cdot cos(\theta)}{\text{pdf} * \text{cpdf}}$, where `pdf` is probability of tracing that ray and `cpdf` continuation probability. 

The function `at_least_one_bounce_radiance` is implemented recursively where we stop ray tracing and use the `one_bounce_radiance` with probability 1 - `cpdf` and continue ray tracing with probability `cpdf` after the first bounce. To keep track of the bounce number for each newly sampled ray direction, we increment the `depth` attribute and terminate execution when it reaches `max_ray_depth`.
