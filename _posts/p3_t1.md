## Ray Generation and Primitive Intersection

### The Pipeline

One algorithm to render photorealistic images of objects is to
generate rays from the camera and trace them to simulate the flow of
light, thereby creating a photorealistic image. The first requirement
of this is ray generation. A ray is defined by its origin
$\mathbf{o}$ and its direction $\mathbf{d}$. Every point along a ray
is given by $\mathbf{o} + t \mathbf{d}$, where $t$ is a scalar. The
point $\mathbf{o}$ is simply the location of the camera in world
coordinates, and $\mathbf{d}$ is the unit vector pointing from
$\mathbf{o}$ in the direction of the ray. In order to find this
direction, we use the coordinates of the pixel on the image plane as
described in the project specification.

Primitives like planes and spheres are defined as mathematical
equations. For example, a plane in 3D is defined as all points $x \in
\mathbb{R}^3$ satisfying $\mathbf{N} \cdot x = 0$ for some vector
$\mathbf{N}$ which is normal to the plane, and a sphere in 3D is
defined as all points $x \in \mathbb{R}^3$ satisfying
$||x - \mathbf{c}||^2 = r^2$, where
$\mathbf{c}$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is its radius.
Each primitive is stored in a list of primitives. For each pixel in
the image, a ray is cast from the camera, and its intersection is
computed for each primitive object in the scene. At this stage, the
color is obtained using the normal vector, as no reflections are being
computed. The color from the nearest primitive is rendered.

Mathematically, in order to compute a ray-primitive intersection, one
simply sets the equations of the ray and the primitive equal, and
solves for $t$. If the solution is $t^\ast$, then the ray-primitive
intersection is located at $p = \mathbf{o} + t^\ast \mathbf{d}$.
Additionally, there is a near and far cutoff plane, so whenever $t^*$
is outside of those two planes, the intersection is not counted.
In practice, solutions of these equations are analytically calculated,
and the solutions coded up as efficient algorithms, as is the case
with the Moller Trumbore algorithm for ray-triangle intersections,
which we used in our project.

### Moller Trumbore Algorithm

The Moller Trumbore algorithm sets the ray equation equal to the
barycentric equation of a triangle, i.e.,

$$
\mathbf{o} + t \mathbf{d} = (1 - b_1 - b_2) P_0 + b_1 P_1 + b_2 P_2,
$$

where $P_0, P_1, P_2$ are the vertices of the triangle in question,
and $t, b_1, b_2$ are the variables being solved for. The solution is
found using Cramer's Rule from linear algebra, and is derived in the
efficient form presented on
[this slide](https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/sp22/lecture/9-22/ray-tracing).
We directly coded up this algorithm.
