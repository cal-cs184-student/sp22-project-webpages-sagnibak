## Collisions with Other Objects

In this part we implement collisions with other objects, by computing
particle-object collisions and then appropriately updating the
positions of the colliding particles while taking into account effects
like friction.

### Cloth-Sphere Intersection

Below you can see the final resting state of the cloth on the sphere
with `ks = 500`, `ks = 5000`, and `ks = 50000` respectively. As we can
see, increasing the spring constant makes the cloth feel stiffer, and
smooths out the creases in the cloth. Note that self-collisions have
already been implemented, so that might affect (improve) how the cloth
looks with `ks = 500`. All other parameters have their default values.

### Cloth-Plane Intersection

Below is the final resting state of the cloth on the plane. All the
parameters of the simulation are the default ones. We use the texture
mode for the shader. This is using `plane.json`.
