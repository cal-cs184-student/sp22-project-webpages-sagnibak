## Task 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals

We implemented the area-weighted vertex normals by creating a helper function to find the normal vectors given a triangle face. 
The area of the triangle is the magnitude of the vector returned by this function divided by two.
To find the triangle faces, we found all the neighboring points and formed a vector of points. 
The face can then be constructed from the vertex and any two consecutive neighbor points. 
To find the final normal vector, we weighted the normal vectors by the area and then normalized it to be a unit vector.
