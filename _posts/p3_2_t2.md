### Rendering of Dragon with different $\alpha$ values

$\alpha = 0.005: $

$\alpha = 0.25: $

$\alpha = 0.5: $

A smaller $\alpha$ corresponds to a smoother surface which corresponds
to a more glossy finish while a larger $\alpha$ corresponds to a more
matte finish. We can see in the images above that as we increase
$\alpha$, the dragon is colored more gold than gray.

### Rendering of Bunny with different sampling methods

Importance Sampling:

As we can see, uniform hemisphere sampling leads to greater variance,
since many of the samples don't contribute any useful information
about radiance. Importance sampling makes each sample more
information-rich, thus reducing variance and perceived noise in the
image.

### Rendering of Spheres with Bismuth

To produce an image with bismuth material, we used $\eta = 2.2260
2.0273 1.7531$ and $k = 3.0795 2.8541 2.5252$ for the red, green, and
blue wavelengths respectively.
