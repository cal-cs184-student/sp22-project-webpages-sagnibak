## Task 4: Edge Flip

In order to implement edge flipping, we mechanically followed
[this](http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2015content/misc/HalfedgeEdgeOpImplementationGuide.pdf)
very helpful guide linked from the spec, which provides a generic
algorithm for writing edge splitting and flipping code. We first made
a diagram of the before and after cases, and then coded up the pointer
gymnastics necessary. No new mesh elements are created for edge
flipping. We simply reassign pointers to reconnect existing edges and
vertices in a way that results in a flipped edge.

Below are some screenshots of the teapot before (top) and after
(bottom) flipping a few edges.

The main debugging for this part actually happened while implementing
part 6. We had a problem with vertex positions and believed initially
that the problem was with the edge flipping algorithm. So at that time
Sagnik rewrote the whole algorithm from scratch. Edge flipping was
fine before and after, but it turned out that the problem was with
edge splitting instead.
