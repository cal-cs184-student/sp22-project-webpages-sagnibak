## Part 1: Masses and Springs

Below we see a screenshot of `scene/pinned4.json`, where we can see
all the springs, and thus the structure of the point masses and
springs. As we can see, the point masses are arranged in a uniform
grid of size `num_width_points`$\times$`num_height_points`, and there
are springs representing constraints. The grid-aligned springs
represent the structural and bending constraints, while the diagonal
springs represent the shearing constraints.

In order to better understand the constraints, we provide the
following visualizations with some constraints hidden. In the first
image below, we display the cloth without any shearing constraints.
Since both structural and bending constraints only connect point
masses that are either above/below (by 1 and 2 respectively) or
left/right (by 1 and 2 respectively), they appear as a regular grid,
with the point masses at their intersections.

Next, we show the wireframe with shearing constraints only. This leads
to a diagonal grid structure, since shearing constraints connect point
masses with their direct diagonal neighbors.

Finally, when we display all the constraints, it looks simply like the
superimposition of the two images above, for obvious reasons.
