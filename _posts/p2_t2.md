## Task 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau

The algorithm for Bezier surfaces is similar to that for Bezier curves. Instead of $n$ control points, Bezier surfaces are parameterized by an array of $n * n$ control points and parameters $u$ and $v$ that both range between 0 and 1. 

The algorithm for this involves looking at slices of the control point array and computing the point on the Bezier Curve for parametric value $u$. 
Then, after finding those $n$ points, those become the control points for finding the point on the Bezier surface. We apply the 1D de Casteljau algorithm with parametric value $v$ to find the final value one the Bezier surface. 

The image below is the teapot evaluated using the Separable 1D de Casteljau algorithm.
