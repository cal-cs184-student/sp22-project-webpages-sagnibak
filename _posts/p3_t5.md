## Part 5: Adaptive Sampling

### Algorithm

The adaptive sampling algorithm is a rather simple modification in
`PathTracer::raytrace_pixel`.
1. Every iteration, a ray is shot out of the camera and traced with
   `PathTracer::est_radiance_global_illumination`, and the illuminance
   and illuminance added to $s_1$ and $s_2$ respectively.
2. Every `samplesPerBatch` iterations, the statistics $\mu$,
   $\sigma^2$, and $I$ are computed.
3. If $I \le \mu \cdot \texttt{maxTolerance}$, then the pixel is said
   to have converged, and the sampling loop is terminated.
4. Otherwise we take another `samplesPerBatch` samples unless we have
   sampled `ns_aa` times.

### Results

Below is a bunny rendered with the command:
```bash
./pathtracer -t 8 -s 2048 -a 64 0.05 -l 1 -m 5 -r 480 360 -f bunny_as.png ../dae/sky/CBbunny.dae
```

As we can see, due to the high number of maximum samples (2048), there
is no visible noise in the image, but due to adaptive sampling, the
image rendered in about 5 minutes.

As we can see from the rate image below, parts of the image that have
colors blended (like the bottom and sides of the rabbit) took more
samples to converge, whereas parts of the image with less indirect
reflections like the walls and the top of the bunny converged with
fewer samples.
