## Self-Collisions

### Fall Montage

Below we show three screenshots of `selfCollision.json` to document
how the cloth falls and folds on itself. These are all with default
simulation parameters and normal shading.

### Effects of `ks` and `density`

The effects of `ks` and `density` depend on the value of the other
parameter. Increasing `density` or decreasing `ks` makes the cloth
behave like silk and other kinds of cloth which fold upon themselves
easily. On the other hand, reducing `density` or increasing `ks` makes
the cloth behave like a stiffer cloth like a rubber sheet, which does
not crease as easily and does not want to readily fold on itself.
Please compare the montages below with the one above to compare
deviations from the default.

Below is a 3-frame montage of `ks = 500` and `density = 15`.
