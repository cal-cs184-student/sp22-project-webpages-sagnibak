## Shaders

### Shader programs

A shader program is a computer program used for calculating levels of
light and color in a image. They are coded for GPUs which allows
parallel execution. Shader code is executed in parallel on a GPU, and
thus it has limitations, such as no recursion.
Vertex shaders executes one part of the graphics pipeline by
calculating transformed positions, normals, and uv coordinates. It
outputs vertex positions.
Fragment shaders take in geometric attributes calculated by the vertex
shaders and computes the color for each fragment. Each fragment can be
a pixel or a fragment that is occluded.

### Blinn-Phong shading

This shading model combines ambient light with a diffuse and specular
reflection component. It uses a half-vector bisector between the
reflected and incident rays to avoid artifacts of Phong reflection.
There is also a parameter $p$ to control the size of specular
highlights. Increasing $p$ reduces the size of specular highlights,
making the surface appear more glossy, as does increasing the specular
coefficient $k_s$.

### Texture Mapping Shader

Below is an example of a custom brick texture.

### Bump Mapping and Displacement Mapping

In bump mapping, the fragments are shaded based on the surface heights
specified in a texture file, but the vertex positions are left
untouched. In displacement mapping, the fragment shading is the same
as in bump mapping, but in addition to that, the vertex positions are
also updated based on the texture used for shading. This makes the
results of displacement mapping more believable, perhaps at the cost
of slightly more compute, and many more texture lookups. As we can
see, in case of displacement mapping, the sphere and the cloth look
like they are actually made of brick, whereas in case of bump mapping,
upon zooming in, it looks like the sphere and cloth are merely covered
in wallpaper that looks like brick.

We are using the custom brick texture for bump mapping, which has been
visualized above. Below are images of bump mapping on the cloth and the sphere.

Below are the images of the cloth and sphere with displacement
mapping.

Since displacement mapping must update the locations of the vertices
of the mesh, using a low mesh resolution results in poor displacement
mapping, as there are very few vertices, so most of the bumps in the
texture are not reflected in the actual mesh. This is a form of
aliasing, where due to the small number of sample points (vertices),
the height detail of the texture is lost. This happens as the
displacement mapping is performed in the vertex shaders, which are
only called once per vertex. On the other hand, using a
high resolution for the mesh results in very accurate displacement
mapping, as the sampling resolution is very high. As we can see, even
the small bumps in the brick texture are accurately displayed on the
sphere in the lower image with displacement mapping. It is, however,
worth noting that since the fragment shader is called a similar number
of times at both mesh resolutions, since the fragment shader is called
once per fragment, the appearance of the surface looks the same once
one does not consider the shape of the sphere itself anymore (the
shapes are clearly different, as described above.).

On the other hand, the fragment shader is always called once per
fragment (pixel), so there is no difference in the rendered results
with low vs. high mesh resolution in the bump mapping images. In both
cases the texture is rendered with the same resolution and the sphere
simply looks round.
