## Shaders

### Shader programs

A shader program is a computer program used for calculating levels of light and color in a image. They are coded for GPUs which allows parallel execution. 
Vertex shaders executes one part of the graphics pipeline by calculating transformed positions, normals, and uv coordinates.
Fragment shaders take in geometric attributes calculated by the vertex shaders and computes the color for each fragment.
