## Task 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling

In order to implement loop subdivision, we closely followed the
algorithm provided in lecture and in the spec. We use a five-stage
algorithm for this:
1. Iterate through all the old vertices and compute their new positions.
2. Iterate through all the old edges and compute their new positions.
3. Split all the old edges.
4. Flip all edges connecting one old and one new vertex.
5. Copy the new vertex positions to the actual vertex positions.

After loop subdivision, meshes end up with more triangles that are
smaller, as existing edges are split to form more edges and vertices.
The flipping ensures that thin triangles that lead to artifacts are not
created as a result of repeated edge splitting. Sharp edges are
smoothed out. This can be desirable or undesirable. In the case of the
teapot below, the sharp edge connecting the handle to the teapot, as
well as the sharp edges in the knob on the lid get smoothed out after
performing loop subdivision thrice. Top is before, bottom is after.
