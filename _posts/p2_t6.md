## Task 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling

In order to implement loop subdivision, we closely followed the
algorithm provided in lecture and in the spec. We use a five-stage
algorithm for this:
1. Iterate through all the old vertices and compute their new positions.
2. Iterate through all the old edges and compute their new positions.
3. Split all the old edges.
4. Flip all edges connecting one old and one new vertex.
5. Copy the new vertex positions to the actual vertex positions.

After loop subdivision, meshes end up with more triangles that are
smaller, as existing edges are split to form more edges and vertices.
The flipping ensures that thin triangles that lead to artifacts are not
created as a result of repeated edge splitting. Sharp edges are
smoothed out. This can be desirable or undesirable. In the case of the
teapot below, the sharp edge connecting the handle to the teapot, as
well as the sharp edges in the knob on the lid get smoothed out after
performing loop subdivision thrice. Top is before, bottom is after.

This is not desirable for the cube, however. It turns into more of a
sphere after performing loop subdivision thrice. Top is before,
bottom, is after.

In order to reduce this effect, it is better to split some of the
edges on edges that lie on flat faces. This prevents loop subdivision
from averaging vertex locations of vertices on different faces of the
cube (we are *not* referring to faces of the mesh here). The top image
shows the split pattern on each face, and the bottom image shows the
result after loop subdivision three times. As you can see, the flat
faces are preserved much better here than in the previous two images.
By making enough triangles on each of the flat faces, we can make the
sharp edges remain more or less sharp as spurious curvature is
introduced less.

The cube becomes asymmetric since the faces of the cube in the mesh
are asymmetric triangles. In order to make the face symmetric, we make
the triangles symmetric. As you can see, this makes the cube symmetric
after loop subdivision three times.
