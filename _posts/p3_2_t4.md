## Thin Lens Model Depth of Field

### Explanation

In a pin-hole camera, there is only one point that all rays pass
through. However, in a thin lens camera, every point on the image
plane is illuminated using an infinitude of points across the thin
lens. This requires us to integrate the incoming radiance over the
entire lens. In order to render an image, we approximate this integral
using Monte Carlo integration, by taking several samples per pixel
through different parts of the lens.
