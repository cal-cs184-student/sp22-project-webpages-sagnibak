In this project, we implemented a cloth simulation. The cloth is
simulated as a structure consisting of point masses connected with
springs that simulate the structural, shearing, and bending
constraints that constrain the motion of the cloth. In this project we
implement various aspects of simulation, including constraint
modeling, numerical integration, and collisions. We also write shaders
for various surface properties.

## Collaboration Between Partners

We split the work in two parts and worked on each part on our own.
When one of us got stuck, the other one helped debug it.
