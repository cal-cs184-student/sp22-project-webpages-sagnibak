## Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchies

### BVH Construction Algorithm

We run the following recursive algorithm to produce the bounding volume
hierarchy:
1. Compute the bounding box corresponding to the current node.
2. If there are `max_leaf_size` elements between the `start` and `end`
  iterators that are passed into the function, then we store them all
  in the current node and return.
3. Otherwise, we need to split the objects into a left and a right
   `BVHNode`.
4. To find the optimal split axis, we find the dimension along which
   the bounding box of the current `BVHNode` has the largest `extent`,
   since it heuristically makes sense to split along the widest
   dimension.
5. Next, we assign half of the elements to the left child `BVHNode`,
   and assign the remaining half to the right child `BVHNode`, and
   recurse.

### Renders Possible only with BVHs

These renders take several minutes without BVHs. Benchmarks in the
next section.

### Benchmarks

|     Mesh        | Number of Primitives | Render Time with BVH Acceleration | Render Time without BVH Acceleration |
|:---------------:|:--------:|:--------:|:----:|
| `CBbunny.dae`   |   28588  | 0.0762 s |  308.6510 s |
| `maxplanck.dae` |   50801  | 0.0877 s |  591.2366 s |
| `CBlucy.dae`    |  133796  | 0.0773 s | 1665.6972 s |
| `wall-e.dae`    |  240326  | 0.1044 s | 3101.7228 s |

As we can see in the table above, without BVHs, rendering time is
directly proportional to the number of primitives (mostly triangles in
the meshes) in the scene, since we need to compute ray-primitive
intersections for each primitive in the scene for each ray. On the
other hand, rendering time appears to be constant and growing very
slowly (logarithmically) with BVHs since ray-primitive intersections
need to be computed for a very small, mostly constant number of
primitives, usually a small multiple of `max_leaf_size`, since
object-primitive intersections are only calculated in leaf nodes, and
a logarithmic number of ray-bounding box intersections need to be
computed to traverse the BVH. These intersections are very fast to
compute since the bounding boxes are axis-aligned.
